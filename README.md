# The Elevation of Montreal

I was inspired to make this visualization after seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/dalofl/the_elevation_of_utah_oc/), and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/db0nqz/the_elevation_of_california_oc/). Given the relatively flat terrain of the island, I scaled the elevation to accentuate differences. 

The data was taken from the city of Montreal [open data portal](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/limites-terrestres) and the [JawgMaps Elevation API](https://www.jawg.io/en/elevation/). The data was collected, assembled and plotted in Python using matplotlib.
